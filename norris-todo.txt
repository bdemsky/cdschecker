check release sequences:
* (done) !is_enabled => future_ordered
* synchronize with a thread that is mo_graph ordered => future_ordered
* (done) no assertions => no fixup
* can I break *all* release sequences? check this before trying to synchronize any of them
* release sequence fixup: forcing a synchronization must force synchronization for *all* related release sequences

Other TODO:

check_current_action, reorganize, move "add_action_to_lists" even earlier (done)

finish release seq (resolve end-of-execution)
- at synchronization, resolve: for those that happen before
  * mutexes (done)
  * joins (done?)
  * release seq. completion
- at end-of-execution, resolve (done, mostly)

(when checking, check head of each thread list for synchronization...) (done)

- snapshot clock vectors? (yes, and/or re-compute) (done)

- thread IDs: not *exactly* unique... unique for replay, but for assertion/send-back, just trace the ancestry (done?)
