The intuition behind the SC development may be able to be weakened as SC for the
key actions. This comes from the observation that the correctness of data
structure designs based on SC rely on the fact that the key memory operations of
the data structure have a total ordering. For others that violate the SC, there
are usually a later fixup routine, making that part less important and necessary
to be SC.

Also, when we expose C/C++ implementations to users, we need to
establish proper synchronization, e.g., enqueue() and dequeu() for concurrent
queues. Plus, this guarantees the correctness of a single object of the data
structure, and it has nothing to do with stronger properties such as
composability.
