AutoMO Artifact Evaluation: Getting Started
===========================================

In order to ease the process of the evaluation of our tool (AutoMO) for the
reviewers, we have packaged our source code, benchmarks and some necessary notes
and results in a virtual machine image with the Ubuntu Linux
(14.04.2-desktop-amd64). Practically if necessary, one can move our source code
and compile it on other Linux-like systems and reproduce our results.

Provided VM
-----------

We provide a VM image with the name "AutoMO.vdi" which is at the same directory
as this getting started guide.  We have configured our VM image with 2 CPUs, 4
GB of RAM and 16 GB of hard disk space under Virtual Box (the Virtual Box 4.1.12
version). We recommend you to configure your own VM environment with at least
the mentioned requirements, and import the AutoMO.vdi file as the existing hard
disk.

The username/password is  ubuntu/12344321.

Login in with this account, open the command line terminal. In the terminal, go
to the directory "~/oopsla15-artifact-automo" with the following command:

cd ~/oopsla15-artifact-automo

The full artifact to be reviewed is located within this directory. Please also
see the more detailed "step_by_step.txt" file (on the same directory as this
file) for how to build the environment and run AutoMO.


Run Natively
------------

In case reviewers want to build AutoMO natively instead of running on a VM, the
full artifact (source code, benchmarks and results) are also packaged in the
"oopsla15-artifact-automo.tar.gz" file. Alternatively, reviewers can also untar
this tarball into some linux machine and then follow the same step-by-step
guide as that in the VM.
