AutoMO Artifact Evaluation: Overview 
------------------------------------

AutoMO is a tool that provides support for developers to port data structures
that originally assume the SC memory model to the C/C++11 memory model. The most
important contribution of AutoMO is that it can automatically infer memory order
parameters of C/C++11 data structures to provide SC for given test cases.

This full artifact is targetted to help reproduce and extend the evaluation of
the main body (Section 8) of the paper submission #126 --- "AutoMO: Automatic
Inference of Memory Order Parameters for C/C++11", which facilites later
research on this field. It includes the source code of the implementation of
AutoMO, the benchmarks we used to evaluate AutoMO, our evaluation results and
the scripts to reproduce our results. We packaged the full artifact with a VM
image, a tarball of source code of both AutoMO and the benchmarks, the scripts
to build and run AutoMO natively, and the getting-started and step-by-step
documents.

We provide two ways for reviewers to evaluate the artifact: run via the provided
VM or build AutoMO natively. Reviewers could first go through the
getting-started file to have a sense how to build the initial environment, and
then follow the step-by-step file to reproduce our results or build their own
example.
